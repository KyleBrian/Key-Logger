# Keylogger Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple keylogger implementation for **educational purposes**. It is designed to show how keystrokes can be recorded and sent to a specified listening port. **This tool should not be used maliciously.**

## Features
- Records keystrokes to a text file.
- Sends recorded keystrokes to a specified listening port on localhost.
- Stops recording when the `ESC` key is pressed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `keyboard` library

You can install the required library using:
```bash
pip install keyboard
```

## Installation
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keylogger_project.git
   cd keylogger_project
   ```

2. **Run the keylogger**:
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

3. **Run the listening server** (in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
   Enter the same port number you used for the keylogger.

## Educational Purpose
This project is intended to raise awareness about how keyloggers operate and to educate users on protecting themselves against such malicious software.

## How to Avoid Malicious Scripts
- **Check the Source**: Always download software from reputable sources. If you receive a script or program from an untrusted source, be cautious.
- **Read Reviews**: Before downloading or running a script, look for reviews or discussions about it online.
- **Use Antivirus Software**: Keep your antivirus software updated, as it can detect and block malicious scripts.
- **Look for Red Flags**: Be wary of scripts that require sensitive information (e.g., passwords) or ask for unnecessary permissions.
- **Run in a Sandbox**: Test suspicious scripts in a controlled environment (like a virtual machine) to prevent damage to your main system.

## Identifying Malicious Scripts
- **Obfuscated Code**: If the code is hard to read or seems unnecessarily complicated, it may be hiding malicious intent.
- **Unusual Behavior**: Scripts that make unexpected changes to system settings or files can be a sign of malicious activity.
- **Network Activity**: Monitor network activity when running unknown scripts. Unusual outgoing connections may indicate data exfiltration.

## Conclusion
Always be cautious when handling scripts or software. This project is meant for educational purposes to help users understand keyloggers and the importance of cybersecurity.
